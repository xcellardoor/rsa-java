rsa-java
========

A simple and custom RSA implementation written in Java.

This implementation works using the fundamental mathematics of RSA, albeit in a messy manner. The method used for encoding text is also entirely custom and not to any formal standard. It may be of use to someone though, so I'm publishing it for people to look at it if they ever have to attempt to use Java/RSA together.
